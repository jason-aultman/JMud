Courtyard
Lush green grass flows freely between the aged cobblestone pathways leading to a large marble statue of a male figure.  The statue is covered in a mossy growth
and looks like it hasn't been tended to in quite some time.  The sounds of water dripping down the stone walls surrounding the courtyard fills the misty air.
